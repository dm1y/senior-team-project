Content (models / materials / overlays/ fonts / images / etc) are stored in TeamProject/Content
Game Data (JSON files / etc) are stored in TeamProject/GameData

Configuration files are stored in TeamProject/Content, and are copied into the 
ouput directory as a post-build step.

If you change directory structure, be sure to modify resources.cfg and resources_d.cfg
to point at the correct places.
